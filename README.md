## 3. How it works

- customers can calculate automatically their cashpresso rates on a product page. 
- customers can add one or more products to their cart 
- on the checkout, in the payment step, customers can choose "cashpresso" as their payment method and recalculate their rates for the order.
- after a successful purchase, customers receive a success page, where the cashpresso widget is triggered and if they are first time customers, they are asked to start a videocall with cashpresso to approve their account. If they are already registered, cashpresso approves the rate.
- after the approvement cashpresso sends the status of the transaction to your store (success, canceled/timeout). If the status is "canceled/timeout", the order will be canceled automatically. The status "success" will assign the status "in process" to the related order.

## 4. FAQ

 - Why I do not see cashpresso payment method in the list?
 
There could be a few reasons. First check total sum limitation. It should be less than the value in your cashpresso account.
The second reason is that digital products are in the cart. It's not possible to use cashpresso for the digital products.

 - Why I do not see cashpresso price around the product price?
 
Check if the product less than 10 Euro or more than total sum limit in your casspresso account settings. Otherwise check if its a digital product. In these cases cashpresso price is not applied.
